## **1. Introduction**

This  guide aims to provide general advice for musicians who want to record guitar or bass tracks on their computers without the need for professional recording studio.

*It presents an easy way of setting up your gear so you can have it ready for recording ad hoc, whenever it’s  to catch a quick idea, sketch a song, or save a riff.*

To simplify the process, the instruction focuses exclusively on recording instruments directly to computer, without the need for a guitar/bass amplifier. Thus, microphone setup for recording is not discussed here.

*Rest assured, using this method doesn’t mean giving up on functionality.  The idea is to enable you to record, mix and produce instrument tracks, to what extent - depends largely on the software you choose for it.*

> The example provided in this guide is based on Windows 10 platform, but similar steps apply to iOS and other operating systems.

## **2. Necessary equipment**

### Hardware list:

1. **Electric guitar/bass**

2. **Computer** (laptop or desktop) with USB connectivity

3. **Audio interface** with 6.3mm Jack socket for guitar recording

4. **Monitor speakers**. They don’t have to be professional **studio monitors**. You can try using your home audio, preferably a stereo system. 
   > IMPORTANT: **Audio reference setup** that you choose must have a line input, which is usually labelled **AUX** or **Line in** at the back of the unit. 

   > WARNING: Certain speaker types/audio setups might not be suitable - they can give inaccurate sound reference or get damaged - always control the output signal level and start from low volume to protect your audio equipment.

5. **Cords and cables with proper plugs**. It depends on your audio setup, but generally:
    - guitar cables have 6.3mm Jack plugs
    - cables connecting your computer or audio interface with studio monitors/audio reference system can have a single or double 6.3mm Jack or 3.5mm mini Jack plugs on the computer end, and single or double RCA/chinch plugs on the other end - depending on the sockets available in the audio unit. 
    - studio monitors use cables with 6.3mm Jack plugs
    - proprietary USB cables to connect your interface to computer should come with the device 
  
    > Remember to measure correct cable lengths to suit your needs!

6. **Optional:** Any guitar **stompboxes** you wish to use. You can use them without the guitar amp, plugged straight into the audio interface. Prepare an extra guitar cable and power source for each.

### Software list:

1. **VST plug-in**. It will allow you to model the guitar sounds in the way you want. Numerous free and paid software options are available on the market.
2. **DAW workstation** (to record the guitar with your VST pug-ins embedded and to arrange your guitar tracks). You can pick from a great choice of industry standards, but be warned - they are pricey!

#### Things to consider:

*By design, this guide gives only a general overview of the type of software solutions available. Modeling sound and recording guitar tracks on a computer is a vast and complicated topic that deserves a separate in-depth insight. Generally, what you should bear in mind when choosing your software platform is:*

- ease-of-use – music recording software, especially DAWs, tend to be complicated, even intimidating at first. Check free demo versions to see which works for you before paying full price.

- compatibility between the VST and DAW you choose – some DAWs don’t support third party VST plug-ins, or you have to pay extra for the functionality. 64-bit vs 32-bit compatibility issues also happen.

-  more complex DAWs enable you to use multiple VST plug-ins, provide advanced mixing options and process automation functions. It’s a whole universe to explore with a plethora of options, chances are you won’t need many of them – think and decide what really suits your purpose.

In the past, audio latency was an issue but on modern computer configurations it shouldn’t be a problem anymore for some years now.

## **3. How to connect**

Guitar into audio interface into computer. Optionally, you can add stompboxes into the signal chain, between guitar and the interface. Signal deterioration is a slight concern, but you should be fine adding as many units as you would normally use in other guitar playing scenarios.

Audio interface into studio monitors/audio reference system. Don’t forget to switch the power on! Check the volume levels on your guitar, audio interface and audio playback equipment before starting. Start with low volume on the playback.

If you connected everything correctly, you should be able to hear your instrument live through your reference speakers. If you happen to use your home audio equipment for the reference sound and worry about destroying it, you should be fine. Essentially, the audio interface is a sound card that modifies the instrument signal and makes it appropriate for the speakers. **Yet still, it is advisable to start from a lower volume level, especially if there are any guitar effects applied to the signal. This is even more true regarding bass**, as the resonances created by this instrument are sometimes hard to predict. So, when it comes to laying these low notes on your track - proceed with caution! 

*Additionally, apart from just recording, with this kind of setup you can also put on a playback track together with your guitar signal and jam along, be it a song you wish to learn or just for fun.*

## **4. How to record**

On a computer:

1. Open your VST, tweak in the guitar sound you want.  Save the preset.
2. Open your DAW, adjust the recording options, embed the VST plug-in into the track. Hit record, play to your heart’s content. Stop, save project.
3. Record more tracks, you may wish to loop and playback some of them to jam along or lay a solo. 
4. Edit to suit your purposes. 
5. Have fun!


## **5. Glossary**

**Amp modeling** - the process of emulating a physical guitar amplifier and applying it to the signal in order to recreate the sound of a specific amplifier model. Done by digital sound processing and used in guitar software.

**Audio in** - the input for the signal path in audio devices.

**Audio interface/Guitar interface/Recording interface** - a device connecting your guitar to computer and converting instrument signals into a format your computer and software recognize. The interface also routes audio from your computer out to your headphones and studio monitors/audio reference. Interfaces typically connect to your computer via USB cables.

**Audio latency** - a delay in the instrument signal reproduction introduced by digital processing. It shouldn’t be an issue on modern computer platforms using Windows 10 or newer.

**Audio out** - the output for the signal path in audio devices.

**Audio reference setup** - any speaker system chosen for presenting the sonic output of your guitar recording setup. Typically, it would be a stereo system with two passive speaker sets and amplification, essentially - your home audio. Alternatively, a more professional option would be active studio monitors designed for record production. 

**AUX** - an auxiliary port is a type of standard connector that accommodates audio signals on audio devices

**DAW workstation** - or digital audio workstation. It’s an electronic device or software used for recording, editing and producing audio files. DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations from a single software program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit. Regardless of configuration, modern DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and mix multiple recordings and tracks into a final produced piece.

**Effect modeling** - the process of emulating a guitar effect pedal and applying it to the signal in order to recreate the sound of a specific guitar effect model. Done by digital sound processing and used in guitar software. It allows to create an effects chain, connecting multiple emulated effect devices in various configurations.

**Guitar effect pedals** - also known as stompboxes are foot-operated boxes that provide sound effects and tone shaping for electric guitars

**Jack plug** - 6.3mm Jack is the guitar/bass connector standard.

**Line in** - the input for the signal path in audio devices.

**Line out** - the output for the signal path in audio devices.

**mini Jack plug** - 3.5mm connector that is commonly used in home audio devices and headphones.

**Studio monitors** - Speaker sets specifically designed for professional audio production and meant to give the most accurate reproduction of the source audio tone. Compared to home audio speakers, the crucial technical difference is that they are active/powered speakers, with an amplifier enclosed in the speaker cabinet. They are built to cope with higher volumes and sound dynamics involved in the studio production.

**RCA plug** - or cinch. It's a connector commonly used to carry audio and video signals.

**Signal path** - the route a particular signal takes through a chain of electronic components on the way to its destination. In audio, it’s usually about connecting different pieces of equipment together and routing signals through them.

**Stompbox** - also known as guitar effect pedals are foot operated boxes that provide sound effects and tone shaping for electric guitars.

**USB 2.0/3.x (type A)** - common connector standard for computer devices.

**USB C** - emerging new connector standard for computer devices.

**VST plug-in** - is an audio plug-in software interface that integrates software effects units into digital audio workstations. It uses digital signal processing to simulate traditional recording studio hardware in software.
